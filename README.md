Most translation applications struggle when translating between different languages because they lack the underlying nuances specific to each one. Essentially, these apps lack the emotional context, the tone and mood that naturally comes when talking. Pluto aims to solve this by using pictures, the universal method of communication. It takes what you want to say and converts it to emoticons, so you can focus on what matters in life, conversing with others.
